# MyOSClassProject
## Advanced OS class project 2015
-------------------------------------------------

All the code written in Java 1.7 and these codes require refactoring. 
Due to busy schedule, I will refactor it later.

## Note

### Simple File System

* Singleton pattern is applied.

### Simple Process and Resource Manager

* Command pattern is applied.
* Singleton pattern is applied.
* State pattern is applied.

### Simple Virtual Memory

* Passed class requirement, but with TLB mode is not correct if it runs independently. Just fix it later.
